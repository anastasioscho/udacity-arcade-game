# Arcade Game

I'm building this game for the purposes of the [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) to showcase my OOP JavaScript skills.

**This project is still under construction.**

## How to Load the game
