# Arcade Game

I'm building this game for the purposes of the [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) to showcase my OOP JavaScript skills.

**This project is still under construction.**

## How to Load the game

- Clone the **[repo](https://github.com/anastasioscho/udacity-arcade-game)** and open index.html.

## Score System

- You get 10 points each time you move forward.
- You loose 10 points each time you move back.
- You get 50 point each time you cross the finish line.

Don't worry, you can't get a negative score!
